StockNavBar Component
Explanation:
The StockNavBar component is a navigation bar that provides links to different sections of the application. It includes links for Home, About, Products, Support, LoginComponent, and SignUp. Each link is either a standard a tag or a Link component from the react-router-dom library, facilitating navigation within the single-page application.

LoginComponent Component
Explanation:
The LoginComponent component represents the LoginComponent page of the application. It contains input fields for email and password, and a "LoginComponent" button. User input is managed using the useState hook, and the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom is employed for navigation. The component validates the user's credentials against stored details and redirects to the dashboard upon successful LoginComponent.

SignUp Component
Explanation:
The SignUp component is responsible for the user registration process. It includes input fields for name, email, and password, along with a "SignUp" button. Similar to the LoginComponent component, user input is managed using the useState hook, and the useNavigate hook is used for navigation. Upon successful registration, user details are stored in local storage, and the user is redirected to the LoginComponent page.

Dashboard Component
Explanation:
The Dashboard component fetches and displays data related to upcoming IPOs (Initial Public Offerings). It utilizes the useEffect hook to fetch data when the component mounts. The data is fetched using the axios library from the IEX Cloud API. The IPO details are then rendered as a list, including the IPO symbol, company name, and expected date. The component provides a glimpse of the IPO calendar within the application.

StockNavBar Component Test
Explanation:
In the StockNavBar component test, we would check if the navigation links are correctly rendered and if they lead to the expected routes. We might mock the Link component to ensure navigation is handled properly. Additionally, we could test if the navigation works when a user clicks on the "LoginComponent" or "SignUp" links.

LoginComponent Component Test
Explanation:
For the LoginComponent component test, we would simulate user input for email and password fields and trigger a LoginComponent attempt. The test would verify whether the handleLogin function correctly navigates to the dashboard upon successful LoginComponent and redirects to the sign-up page for unsuccessful LoginComponent attempts.

SignUp Component Test
Explanation:
In the SignUp component test, we would simulate user input for name, email, and password fields and trigger a signup attempt. The test would verify whether the handleSignup function correctly stores user details in local storage and navigates to the LoginComponent page upon successful signup.

Dashboard Component Test
Explanation:
The test for the Dashboard component would mock the data fetching mechanism (axios in this case) to simulate the API response. We would then check if the component correctly renders the IPO details received from the mock API response. Additionally, we might test the component's behavior when an error occurs during data fetching.

These tests ensure that each component behaves as expected, handling user interactions, navigation, and data fetching appropriately. The goal is to validate that the components are working as intended in various scenarios.
